# Contributing to the HoloCosmo Project

Don't worry, we don't adhere to dogmas. But we do have a system - and it works.

This document outlines the principles and practices that guide contributions to the HoloCosmo Project – whether you're running simulations, writing code, proposing theory, or simply following along.

This is not a typical research project. There are no positions, titles, or credentials within HoloCosmo. There are only contributors and threads to follow.

## Our Posture

The HoloCosmo Project follows four modes:  
**Speculate. Formulate. Calculate. Observe.**  
In that order. In that rhythm.

We explore ideas that may not yet have conventional justification – but we treat them with rigorous method, precise language, and replicable structure. We follow them where they lead, and document the path clearly, even (especially) when they fall apart.

We do not claim or impose a theory.  
We do not assert that any of our models are "right."  
We do insist that they are clearly stated, traceably tested, and falsifiably defined.
Moreover, we do realize that there are times when the models are correct, but we can be mistaken nonetheless. Nature is like that.

Our guiding principle is **epistemic fidelity**.  
That means: staying faithful to what the work actually shows. Not what we want it to show, or what others expect it to mean. If we succeed, it is the result of the model – and ideas don't respect hierarchy, so whether it's a seasoned modeler or not... Well, you catch the drift.

If we go astray, the trail is documented too. That's actually hugely important: we stress null results and dead ends. We've been there before. We'll be there again. Let's not let that stop us from enjoying the path, whatever it is and wherever it takes.

## Authorship and Attribution

HoloCosmo is not anonymous, but it is non–possessive.

Contributors are free to associate themselves with their work – or not. All commits, notebooks, papers, and discussion threads are traceable. But the project does not issue bylines, rank contributions, or assign ownership. We do not maintain internal hierarchies.

If we publish something at some point, attributions will go where they belong: in the grounding work, past research, foundations, and obviously the authors – including the project. We're not here to build a cathedral but scaffolding.

## Participation Guidelines

- Precision. Use clear definitions and be explicit about assumptions.
- Generosity. Respect others' ideas, and extend them thoughtfully.
- Non-territoriality. We’re not defending disciplines or borders.
- Rigor. Conjectures are welcomed – if they can be formalized, tested, or refuted.
- Friction. There is no rush here. We value depth over momentum. But if you can help us speed up our routines, whether by caching or whatever, we'd probably buy you flowers, maybe a bottle of white.

## When You Contribute

Any contribution – a code commit, a simulation run, a comment – participates in a broader collective inquiry. Please:

1. Document your work clearly and self-sufficiently.
2. Link back to the theoretical thread or question it engages.
3. Flag assumptions and approximations honestly.
4. If you're refining or challenging previous work, do so constructively.
5. We are FAFO-compliant (fool around, find out). We hope you're too. We have enough curly-headed superiors at work and at home already.

## If You Disagree

We welcome dissent and divergence. If your view forks from the main path, document it. Show your reasoning. We don’t resolve disagreement through authority – only through clarity.

Don't disagree just because of a dogma, though. Not everything popular is the best thing out there. The survivor bias cuts both ways, and many nice things have been wiped off of history books.

## Why This Exists

Not to publish first. Not to defend a theory. Not to own an idea.

This project exists because we are curious whether the structure of quantum entanglement gives rise to something geometric, gravitational, or otherwise coherent. We're following that question with rigor and epistemic honesty – and no promise of resolution.

If we do publish, well, we'll figure it out. And so will you. The record is out there in the public anyway.

You are welcome to contribute or to wander about.
