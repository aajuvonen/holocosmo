# The HoloCosmo Project

## What This Is

This repository contains an independent exploration of cosmological structure under a single working assumption:  
the physical reality is a holographic projection of information encoded on a time-evolving, discrete boundary surface.

This is not a conventional research project.  
It is not a theory to be proven.  
It is not a critique of existing models.  
It is a structured exercise in *scientific curiosity*, guided by discipline, humility, and non-dogmatic reasoning.
It is citizen science—for playing in other people's sandboxes, but not for stepping on anyone's toes.

## What This Is Not

- Not an attempt to **refute** mainstream cosmology or quantum gravity.
- Not a claim to **novel physical laws** or predictive superiority.
- Not a joke, parody, or thoughtless contrarianism.
- Not a platform for polemics or metaphysical evangelism.

## Posture of Inquiry

This project is based on a **single a priori assumption**:

> That reality, in its observed dimensionality, emerges from a discrete, lower-dimensional boundary via a holographic mapping—  
> and that the resolution of this mapping evolves as the boundary expands.

Everything in this repository is approached through that lens. The goal is not to make the data fit the model—but to explore whether **a coherent, data-respecting interpretation** of reality can emerge from this fixed metaphysical stance.

Contradictions are not dismissed.  
Confirmations are not celebrated.  
Both are *tested for coherence*, not used to prove or disprove.

## What You'll Find Here

- **`doc/`**: Framing documents explaining the metaphysical foundation, links to existing literature, and known limitations.
- **`src/`**: Core computational models exploring cosmological evolution under the holographic assumption.
- **`data/`**: Various results of the core computational models.

## Why This Exists

Sometimes a model is not a claim—it is a question.  
This repository is that question, rendered in code.

If you are here to test, refine, or calmly challenge that question, you're welcome.  
If you are here to seek orthodoxy or rejection, you're in the wrong place.
